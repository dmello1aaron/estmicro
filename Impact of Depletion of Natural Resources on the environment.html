    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The depletion of natural resources is a growing concern that threatens the balance of ecosystems, global climate, and human survival. This issue arises due to unsustainable practices, overexploitation, and environmental degradation.</p>
        <p>Natural resources such as water, forests, fossil fuels, and minerals are crucial to life on Earth, yet human activities are depleting them at alarming rates. This website provides insights into the causes, effects, and potential solutions to this issue.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Resource Depletion</h2>
        <p>There are multiple factors contributing to the depletion of natural resources, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Logging for timber, agriculture expansion, and urbanization contribute to extensive deforestation, Loss of biodiversity, disrupted ecosystems, and increased greenhouse gas emissions are direct outcomes..</li>
            <li><strong>Industrialization:</strong> The rise of industries has significantly accelerated resource extraction and pollution, depleting water, minerals, and fossil fuels.</li>
            <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Massive deforestation for agriculture, logging, and urbanization leads to the loss of forests, which are crucial for carbon sequestration and biodiversity.</li>
            <li><strong>Unsustainable Agriculture:</strong> Over-farming, excessive use of fertilizers, and land degradation are causing soil erosion and loss of fertility.</li>
            <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Pollution from industrial waste, chemicals, and plastic reduces the quality and usability of natural resources like water and soil.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="effects">
        <h2>Effects of Resource Depletion</h2>
        <p>The depletion of natural resources has far-reaching consequences, both for the environment and humanity. Some of the major effects include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> The destruction of habitats, such as forests and oceans, leads to the extinction of species, affecting the balance of ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> The overuse of fossil fuels increases carbon emissions, contributing to global warming, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Scarcity:</strong> Freshwater resources are being overused and polluted, leading to water shortages that affect agriculture, industry, and human survival.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Degradation:</strong> Unsustainable farming and deforestation lead to the loss of fertile soil, reducing agricultural productivity and food security.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Crisis:</strong> The over-extraction of non-renewable resources like oil, gas, and coal is leading to an impending energy crisis as these resources are finite.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="solutions">
        <h2>Solutions to Resource Depletion</h2>
        <p>Tackling resource depletion requires a global effort and sustainable practices. Some of the potential solutions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Investing in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower can reduce the dependency on fossil fuels.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> Promoting organic farming, crop rotation, and reduced pesticide use can help maintain soil fertility and reduce environmental damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Implementing efficient irrigation systems, reducing water wastage, and protecting freshwater sources can help combat water scarcity.</li>
            <li><strong>Reforestation:</strong> Planting trees and conserving forests can help restore biodiversity and improve carbon sequestration.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:</strong> Minimizing waste and promoting the recycling of materials can lower resource demand and reduce environmental impact.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="statistics">
        <h2>Global Statistics on Resource Depletion</h2>
        <p>Here are some alarming global statistics on the depletion of natural resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Around 1.2 billion people live in areas of water scarcity, and by 2025, nearly two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages.</li>
            <li><strong>Forests:</strong> Approximately 18 million acres of forests are lost each year due to deforestation, affecting biodiversity and the climate.</li>
            <li><strong>Fossil Fuels:</strong> At the current rate of consumption, it’s estimated that oil reserves could run out in the next 50 years, natural gas in 60 years, and coal in 100 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Fisheries:</strong> Over 90% of the world’s fisheries are fully exploited or overfished, threatening marine ecosystems and food security.</li>
        </ul>
